## What is a style guide?

A style guide provides conventions that make code look uniform across different code bases.

    if (n > 0) {
        System.out.println(n);
    }

Without coding standards the same code would look different based on personal preference.

    if(n>0)
    {
        System.out.println(n);
    }

## Why use a style guide?

The lack of consistency requires more effort from the reader to adjust to code written by different programmers.

There are also practical reasons. If two programmers work on the same code and submit updates to a version control system, each new version would be cluttered with slight formatting changes that don't affect how the code functions.
